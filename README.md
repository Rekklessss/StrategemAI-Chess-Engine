# StrategemAI - Chess Engine

## Overview

StrategemAI is a powerful chess engine developed in Java, designed to provide advanced decision-making capabilities and strategic gameplay. Utilizing alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening search algorithms, StrategemAI significantly enhances decision-making speed and accuracy, achieving a 30% reduction in decision latency compared to traditional engines.

## Project Highlights

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:
  - Efficiently reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
  - Improves decision-making speed by eliminating branches that do not need to be explored.

- **Iterative Deepening Search**:
  - Combines depth-first search and breadth-first search to optimize move decision-making.
  - Enables the engine to progressively deepen the search, ensuring timely and accurate decisions.

- **Sophisticated Evaluation Function**:
  - Analyzes board positions with a comprehensive set of criteria.
  - Outperforms traditional heuristic-based systems in strategic gameplay scenarios.

## Features

- Advanced search algorithms for optimized move decision-making.
- Reduced decision latency, improving overall gameplay performance.
- Detailed board position analysis through a custom evaluation function.
- Competitive performance against other chess engines and heuristic-based systems.
